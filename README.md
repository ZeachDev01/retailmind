## Local browser testing

The end-to-end inventory scan workflow uses Playwright with Chromium. It starts
PHP's built-in web server, creates isolated test records in the configured local
database, and removes those records when the test finishes.

Prerequisites:

- PHP and MySQL are running locally.
- The schema and migrations have been applied to the database configured in
  `.env`.
- Node.js 22, 24, or 26 is installed.

Install the project dependencies and Chromium once:

```powershell
npm install
npm run playwright:install
```

Run the browser workflow:

```powershell
npm run test:e2e
```

The test must only be pointed at a disposable local or CI database. Do not use
production database credentials in `.env` when running it.

## Cash Refund database testing

The refund race test creates a temporary database from the canonical table
definitions, runs competing refunds, checks legacy reversal isolation, and drops
the temporary database. Use a local MySQL/MariaDB account with permission to create
and drop databases. It reads connection settings from `.env` and does not write
to the configured Store database.

```powershell
$env:RUN_REFUND_DB_TESTS = '1'
php src/backend/tests/cash_refund_concurrency_integration.php
```

The same flag enables this test in `src/backend/tests/run_all.sh`.
