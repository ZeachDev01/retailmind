## Local browser testing

The end-to-end inventory scan workflow uses Playwright with Chromium. It starts
PHP's built-in web server, creates isolated test records in the configured local
database, and removes those records when the test finishes.

Prerequisites:

- PHP and MySQL are running locally.
- The schema and migrations have been applied to the database configured in
  `.env`.
- Node.js 22, 24, or 26 is installed.

Install the project dependencies and Chromium once:

```powershell
npm install
npm run playwright:install
```

Run the browser workflow:

```powershell
npm run test:e2e
```

The test must only be pointed at a disposable local or CI database. Do not use
production database credentials in `.env` when running it.
